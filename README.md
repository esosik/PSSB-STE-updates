# PSSB-STE-updates

Created by Beth A. Sosik, spring/summer 2024.

Project to update/correct Standard Taxonomic Effort (STE) and taxa attribute assignments in the Puget Sound Stream Benthos (PSSB) database, and to create taxa mappings based on the taxa translator produced by the regional biological condition gradient (BCG) workgroup. This effort was done in tandem with a related project to update the backend of PSSB to allow admins to add/modify STE and attribute tables, and to allow admins to specify taxa mappings. Taxa mapping involves assigning indiscernible taxonomic groups to operational taxonomic units (OTUs). This will facilitate score comparisons and trend analyses of samples collected in different years and identified by different labs.
